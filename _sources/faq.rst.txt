I'm on Linux and anytime I try to upload to the brain it says ``could not open port /dev/tty/ACM0``.

I keep getting a Data Abort Exception, but the error message is too vague for me to understand what is wrong.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you happen to get a red box on the brain's screen with the label ``Data Abort Exception``, you'll likely need to view the stacktrace to properly decipher what went wrong.

First, you'll need to connect the robot and start up the PROS terminal with the following command:
``pros terminal``
Once the termina has been loaded, start the program again. A large string of red characters should now appear in your PROS terminal. All we're worried about is this bit of text:


.. code-block:: shell

   BEGIN STACK TRACE
   0x0000000
   0x0000000
   END OF STACK TRACE


The list of numbers represents the memory addresses the program followed that resulted in the error. Go ahead and copy the addresses for the following command. 

We can convert these addresses to line numbers in our code by using the ``arm-none-eabi-addr2line`` utility provided by the PROS toolchain. Execute this command in the root of your project:

.. code-block:: shell

   arm-none-eabi-addr2line -faps -e ./bin/hot.package.elf


While the program is running, paste the values. This should end up printing the exact file name and line number where the exception occurred. 


.. note::
   You might have to change ``hot.package.elf`` to ``cold.package.elf`` if you only see a bunch of question marks.
